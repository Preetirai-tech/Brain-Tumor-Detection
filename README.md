## Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Developed a deep learning model using CNN to detect brain tumors in MRI images with a high degree of accuracy.

  - Trained the model on a dataset of MRI images with 95% accuracy.
  - Evaluated the model using a test dataset of MRI images, achieving an accuracy of 97%.
